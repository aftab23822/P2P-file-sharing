# P2P-file-sharing

In this project,a simple 'Napster' like P2P system for file search and retrieval has been implemented. A user (peer) joins a
P2P system by contacting a central server (server). The peer publishes the files she wishes to share by
specifying the same to the central server. The peer searches for a file, again by contacting the central
server. Based on input from the server, peer fetches the file from another peer (who has the file).
